The galaxy is in disarray. 
Anarchy spreads across the galaxy. 
No order is to be found. 
As a result of vast human expansion, no governing body has the capability to unite all of humanity. 
Therefore, a vast amount of factions have emerged, each with their own agendas and interests, and such, various militias needed to be constructed. 
In some of these militias, the organization varies heavily. 
You as a commander are based in the Yunnan Systemic Alliance. 
Pioneers of security, economy, and technology, their military competes well within the galaxy. 
You command a team in the special operations division. 
This division can be found well across the galaxy. 
It is standard for each team in this division to contain six members. 
Your task as a commander from the special operations division is to carry out contracts given by the YSA.
